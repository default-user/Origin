title: "Authority.nz — MESO Constitution + MACRO Atlas"
summary: >
  Authority.nz is a public anchor / governance oracle / integrity bulletin concept.
  In the six-section collation, it hosts two layers. MESO (meso.authority.nz) is
  the published constitution: a signed artefact registry of treaties, schemas,
  policy packs, receipt templates, and glossary, versioned and verifiable by
  signatures and hashes. MACRO (stanspace.authority.nz) is the navigable atlas:
  a public graph of stans and concepts with routing, comparisons, consequence
  overlays, and crystal export/import. MESO publishes governance, not private life.
  MACRO stays humane by being exportable, forkable, and plural.
