## Level 0: Summary

Authority.nz is conceived as a public anchor / governance oracle / integrity bulletin. It features tamper-evident logging, anchoring, and selective disclosure. A CLI teaching pathway guides users from novice to expert.

> **Constraint**: Avoid claiming real-world deployment details.

## Level 1: Authority.nz Concept

### 1.1 What is Authority.nz?

A conceptual system providing:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Public Anchor | Verifiable reference point |
| Governance Oracle | Authoritative policy source |
| Integrity Bulletin | Tamper-evident announcements |

### 1.2 Core Features

- **Tamper-evident log**: Records cannot be secretly modified
- **Anchoring**: Tie claims to verifiable points
- **Selective disclosure**: Reveal only what's needed

### 1.3 CLI Teaching Pathway

| Level | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| Novice | Basic queries, simple lookups |
| Intermediate | Complex queries, result interpretation |
| Advanced | Scripting, integration patterns |
| Expert | Architecture understanding, extension |

## Level 2: Conceptual Architecture

### 2.1 Tamper-Evident Log

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│         AUTHORITY.NZ LOG           │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Entry 1: [hash] ← genesis          │
│ Entry 2: [hash] ← includes hash 1  │
│ Entry 3: [hash] ← includes hash 2  │
│ ...                                │
│ Entry N: [hash] ← includes hash N-1│
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each entry includes the hash of the previous, creating a chain. Modification of any entry breaks the chain.

### 2.2 Anchoring

Claims can be "anchored" to log entries:
- Timestamp proof
- Content hash proof
- Policy version proof

### 2.3 Selective Disclosure

Reveal specific facts without exposing full data:
- Proof of attribute without full identity
- Proof of compliance without full audit
- Proof of authority without full credentials

---

## Level 3: CLI Concept

### 3.1 Sample Commands (Conceptual)

```bash
# Novice
authority lookup <anchor-id>
authority verify <claim>

# Intermediate
authority query --filter "type=policy" --since 2025-01-01
authority validate <document> --against <policy-anchor>

# Advanced
authority anchor create --content <file> --publish
authority script run <script.auth>

# Expert
authority admin audit --full
authority extend --module <custom-module>
```

### 3.2 QED Integration

QED (C0008) utilizes Authority.nz:
- Verification requests
- Anchor lookups
- Integrity checks
- Teaching pathway

## Constraints

> Avoid claiming real-world deployment details.
