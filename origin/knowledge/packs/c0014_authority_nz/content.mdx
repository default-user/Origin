# Authority.nz — MESO Constitution + MACRO Atlas

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

Authority.nz is conceived as a public anchor / governance oracle / integrity bulletin. In the six-section collation (C0024), it hosts two layers: MESO (meso.authority.nz) is the published constitution, and MACRO (stanspace.authority.nz) is the navigable atlas. MESO publishes governance, not private life. MACRO stays humane by being exportable, forkable, and plural.

> **Constraint**: Avoid claiming real-world deployment details.

## Level 1: Authority.nz Concept

### 1.1 What is Authority.nz?

A conceptual system providing:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Public Anchor | Verifiable reference point |
| Governance Oracle | Authoritative policy source |
| Integrity Bulletin | Tamper-evident announcements |

### 1.2 Core Features

- **Tamper-evident log**: Records cannot be secretly modified
- **Anchoring**: Tie claims to verifiable points
- **Selective disclosure**: Reveal only what's needed

### 1.3 CLI Teaching Pathway

| Level | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| Novice | Basic queries, simple lookups |
| Intermediate | Complex queries, result interpretation |
| Advanced | Scripting, integration patterns |
| Expert | Architecture understanding, extension |

---

## Level 2: MESO — The Published Constitution

### 2.1 What is MESO?

MESO (meso.authority.nz) is the public constitution. It is where treaties, definitions, schemas, policy packs, and receipt templates live as versioned artefacts. It is stable, diffable, and verifiable by signatures and hashes.

### 2.2 MESO Artefact Registry

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Glossary | Nested deac definitions |
| Treaties/charters | Governance agreements |
| Schemas | OpenAPI/JSON Schema specifications |
| Policy packs | CDI rules for governance decisions |
| Receipt templates | Auditable trace formats |
| Compatibility matrix | Cross-implementation verification |
| Append-only ledger | Tamper-evident governance log |

### 2.3 MESO Invariants

- Clients verify signatures, fail closed on mismatch
- MESO publishes governance, not private life
- That separation is what prevents "authority" from becoming surveillance
- Artefacts are versioned, diffable, and verifiable

### 2.4 MESO Purpose

MESO lets humans read the rules and decide whether to consent. It lets implementers build compatible systems without guessing. It makes trust verifiable without leaking private life.

**MESO makes governance public, stable, and verifiable.**

## Level 3: MACRO — The Navigable Atlas

### 3.1 What is MACRO?

MACRO (stanspace.authority.nz) is the public map of stans and concepts, with routing, comparisons, and consequence overlays. It makes understanding navigable infrastructure.

### 3.2 MACRO Services

| Service | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Stans library | Catalogue of interpretive requirements |
| Concept graph | Concepts with reasons on edges |
| Routing APIs | Next stans, curricula, comparisons |
| Crystal export/import | Portable knowledge capsules |
| Consequence overlays | Policy externality mapping |

### 3.3 MACRO Capabilities

MACRO can:
- Show the next five stans someone needs
- Show where a debate's hidden prerequisites diverge
- Show where a policy's externalities land
- Route learning through optimal prerequisite paths

### 3.4 MACRO Humane Invariants

MACRO stays humane by being:
- **Exportable**: a map you can take with you
- **Forkable**: you can create your own version
- **Plural**: not a priesthood you must obey

**MACRO makes knowledge navigable, exportable, and humane.**

## Level 4: MESO + MACRO Integration

### 4.1 Layer Relationships

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            MACRO: stanspace.authority.nz      │
│   Stans library, concept graph, routing,     │
│   crystal export, consequence overlays       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            MESO: meso.authority.nz           │
│   Glossary, treaties, schemas, policy packs, │
│   receipt templates, append-only ledger      │

│   Thread-tending intelligence under          │
│   single principal, enforces MESO rules      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Relationship to MICRO

MESO publishes the governance artefacts that MICRO enforces. MACRO publishes the atlas that MICRO can consult for routing understanding. MICRO (C0010) is the execution layer; MESO and MACRO are the public surfaces.

### 4.3 Relationship to Stangraphics

Stangraphics (C0011) provides the science of understanding as navigation. MACRO is the infrastructure that makes that science publicly accessible. The stans library in MACRO is the materialised graph from Stangraphics.

### 4.4 QED Integration

QED (C0008) utilises Authority.nz:
- Verification requests
- Anchor lookups
- Integrity checks
- Teaching pathway

## Constraints

> Avoid claiming real-world deployment details.

Authority.nz is a conceptual system. Specific URLs, deployment status, or operational details are not provided. MESO and MACRO are architectural layers, not operational services.
