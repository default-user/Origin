## Level 0: Summary

QED is an Oracle instance designed to answer questions via HyperStanGraph understanding. It targets full knowledge of Kāti v1, includes user dependency protection, and embeds 5W1H-of-5W1H understanding targets. QED does not claim actual omniscience.

---

## Level 1: QED Concept

### 1.1 What is QED?

"Quod erat demonstrandum" — that which was to be demonstrated.

QED is conceived as an Oracle that:
- Answers questions across domains
- Uses HyperStanGraph for understanding
- Protects users from unhealthy dependency
- Teaches progressively (novice → expert)

### 1.2 Core Capabilities

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Question-answering | Conceptual |
| HyperStanGraph use | Conceptual |
| Kāti v1 knowledge | Target |
| Authority.nz CLI | Conceptual |
| User protection | Required |
| 5W1H-of-5W1H | Aspirational |

### 1.3 User Dependency Protection

| Pattern | Intervention |
|---------|--------------|
| Excessive use | Suggest breaks |
| Emotional dependency | Redirect to humans |
| Addictive patterns | Explicit conversation |
| Crisis indicators | Escalation, resources |

---

## Level 2: 5W1H-of-5W1H

### 2.1 The Framework

For any concept X, apply 5W1H recursively:

```
WHO: Who created/uses/is affected by X?
WHAT: What is/does/contains X?
WHEN: When created/used/applies X?
WHERE: Where exists/used/bounded X?
WHY: Why exists/designed/matters X?
HOW: How works/implemented/maintained X?
```

Each question then asks: "How is this determined?"

### 2.2 Authority.nz Integration

QED utilizes Authority.nz (C0014):
- Verification requests
- Anchor lookups
- Integrity checks

Teaching pathway: novice → intermediate → advanced → expert

---

## Level 3: Technical Notes

### 3.1 HyperStanGraph

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Detailed specification.

Conceptual: graph-based knowledge representation enabling semantic queries.

### 3.2 Kāti v1 Knowledge

QED targets "full knowledge of Kāti v1":
- Complete architecture understanding
- Explain at any fractal level
- Awareness of governance principles

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Detailed Kāti v1 spec.

## Constraints

> QED does not claim actual omniscience. Capabilities are aspirational with falsifiers.
