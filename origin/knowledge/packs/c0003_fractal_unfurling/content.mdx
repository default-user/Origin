# Fractal Unfurling / Nth-Degree Documentation

## Level 0: Summary

Fractal documentation unfurls from summary to detail. Every major document has Level 0 (summary), Level 1 (sections), Level 2 (subsections), and arbitrary deeper levels. Consistency is mandatory: deeper levels expand, never contradict.

---

## Level 1: The Fractal Pattern

### 1.1 Structure

```
Document
├── Level 0: Summary (1-2 paragraphs)
├── Level 1: Sections
│   ├── 1.1 Section
│   ├── 1.2 Section
│   └── 1.3 Section
├── Level 2: Subsections
│   ├── 2.1.1 Subsection
│   ├── 2.1.2 Subsection
│   └── ...
└── Level n: Arbitrary depth
```

### 1.2 Audience by Level

| Level | Audience | Time |
|-------|----------|------|
| 0 | Everyone | 30 seconds |
| 1 | Interested | 5 minutes |
| 2 | Engaged | 15 minutes |
| n | Deep divers | As needed |

### 1.3 Consistency Rule

> **Rule**: No level may contradict a higher level. Each level expands, never contradicts.

Example:
- Level 0: "The system is safe"
- Level 1: "Safety includes boundaries, monitoring, and stops" ✓
- Level 2: "Boundaries are enforced by haptic feedback" ✓
- ❌ Invalid: Level 2 says "Safety is optional"

---

## Level 2: Implementation

### 2.1 Writing Process

1. **Start at Level 0**: Write the summary first
2. **Expand to Level 1**: Break into major sections
3. **Deepen to Level 2**: Add detail to each section
4. **Verify consistency**: Check no contradictions
5. **Add deeper levels**: As content demands

### 2.2 Reading Process

1. **Read Level 0**: Get the gist
2. **Decide interest**: Continue or stop
3. **Read Level 1**: Understand structure
4. **Drill into Level 2+**: Where curious

### 2.3 Consistency Verification

For each statement at Level n:
- Does it expand Level n-1? ✓
- Does it contradict Level n-1? ✗

## Level 3: Fractal in Practice

### 3.1 This Document

This very document demonstrates fractal unfurling:
- Level 0 gave you the concept in 2 sentences
- Level 1 showed structure, audience, and rules
- Level 2 covered implementation details
- Level 3 (here) provides meta-reflection and examples

### 3.2 Consistency Example

From C0001 (Holodeck):
- L0: "Holodeck combines first-person with God's-eye"
- L1: "View switching enables seamless transition"
- L2: "Transition uses crossfade with haptic cue"
- L3: "Crossfade duration: 200-500ms, user-configurable"

Each level adds detail without contradicting the level above.
