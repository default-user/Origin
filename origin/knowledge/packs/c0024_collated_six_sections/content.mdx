## Level 0: Summary

A humane intelligence stack is built by unifying two maps: the map of what it takes to understand (Stangraphics) and the map of what happens when you act (Consequentialism), then delivering that unity through governed Cognitive Fusion. The smallest living unit is MICRO, a thread-tending OI under a single principal with stop-wins, partitioned memory, and capability-gated actuation. The public spine is MESO, a versioned authority surface for treaties, schemas, and policies that makes trust verifiable without leaking private life. The large-scale atlas is MACRO, a navigable stanspace that routes learning, exposes disagreement as prerequisite mismatch, and overlays consequence ledgers so cleverness cannot hide who pays.

## Level 1: The Six Sections

### 1.1 The Six Sections Being Collated

| # | Section | Domain |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | The Science of Stangraphics | Map of understanding |
| 2 | The Science of Consequentialism | Map of consequences |
| 3 | The Age of Cognitive Fusion | Product stack: UX + Hardware |
| 4 | MICRO: OI | Smallest living unit |
| 5 | MESO: meso.authority.nz | Public constitution |
| 6 | MACRO: stanspace.authority.nz | Navigable atlas |

### 1.2 Core Primitives (Recur Across All Six)

| Primitive | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Stan | Unit of interpretive requirement |
| Graph | Explicit structure of concepts, prerequisites, and routes |
| Ledger | Explicit structure of consequences, stakeholders, and costs |
| CIF | Integrity firewall for inputs and outputs |
| CDI | Conscience judge for decisions and actions |
| Capability | Scoped permission for actuation |
| Receipt | Auditable trace with minimal-by-default disclosure |
| Stop-wins | The principal can halt at any time |
| Fail-closed | If governance is missing, action is refused |

### 1.3 How the Six Sections Interlock

- **Stangraphics** gives the map of understanding.
- **Consequentialism** gives the map of consequences.
- **Cognitive Fusion** is the era-level delivery: how the maps become products.
- **MICRO** is the smallest living unit: the OI that actually does the work.
- **MESO** is the public constitution: published rules and artefacts.
- **MACRO** is the atlas: a public navigable universe of stans, concepts, and overlays.

## Level 2: Proof

### 2.1 Claim 1: Coherence

**The system is coherent because it closes the loop between knowledge and consequence.**

Stangraphics routes understanding. Consequentialism audits outcomes. When combined, "what we know" and "what we cause" cannot drift apart silently.

### 2.2 Claim 2: Governability

**The system is governable because every powerful move passes through explicit gates.**

CIF controls what enters and leaves. CDI controls what is allowed to happen. Capability tokens constrain tools. Receipts anchor accountability. Stop-wins prevents runaway.

### 2.3 Claim 3: Scalability

**The system scales because the layers separate private life from public governance.**

MICRO holds personal threads and partitioned memory. MESO publishes stable governance artefacts without leaking privacy. MACRO publishes the atlas for routing understanding without claiming monopoly.

### 2.4 Claim 4: Anti-Crown

**The system avoids becoming a crown because export, refusal, and identity boundaries are first-class.**

Exportable crystals prevent lock-in. Fail-closed prevents "do anyway." Identity boundaries prevent hive mind. A single principal retains root authority.

## Level 3: Exposition

### 3.1 Stangraphics: Understanding as Navigation

The first truth is that learning is not magic. Most "I don't get it" is not stupidity, it is missing prerequisites. Stangraphics names that truth and makes it drawable. It treats concepts as coordinates, and learners as moving through a terrain made of requirements. In that terrain, every cliff edge is a missing stan. Every argument is a collision of two stan-profiles. Every good teacher is a route planner. So Stangraphics turns understanding into navigation, and it does it with dignity, because it replaces shame with maps.

### 3.2 Consequentialism: Outcomes as Mechanics

A second truth sits under the first. Knowledge is not neutral. What you believe makes some actions cheap. When actions become cheap, harms become easy. So we need a science that does not just map understanding but maps what follows. That is Consequentialism as mechanics, not morality theatre. It is a ledger discipline. It forces you to name stakeholders, carry uncertainty, expose discounting, and treat irreversibility like a red flag. It refuses the oldest trick in history: winning by hiding who pays.

### 3.3 Cognitive Fusion: Governed Toolchain

Put those two sciences together, and you get an era: the Age of Cognitive Fusion. Fusion does not mean "smarter chat." Fusion means cognition becomes a governed toolchain: multiple models, tools, memories, and policies orchestrated through explicit structures. The point is not maximum power. The point is safe power. The point is making stopping easier than doing. That era arrives when intelligence is delivered as an organ system, not a hallucination machine: immune system (CIF), conscience (CDI), muscles (tools), bones (schemas), and nerves (stop-wins).

### 3.4 MICRO: The OI

At the smallest level, this becomes MICRO: the OI. Not a model, a governed system around models. An OI is thread-tending intelligence under a single human principal. It holds partitioned memory, maintains commitments, and acts only through gates. It can plan, propose, execute, and explain, but it can also refuse, degrade, and stop instantly. MICRO is where ethics becomes literal execution rules. If MICRO is correct, scale is safe. If MICRO is wrong, scale becomes a weapon.

### 3.5 MESO: The Constitution

At the middle layer, we need legitimacy and portability. That becomes MESO: meso.authority.nz, the published constitution. MESO is where treaties, definitions, schemas, policy packs, and receipt templates live as versioned artefacts. It is stable, diffable, and verifiable by signatures and hashes. It lets humans read the rules and decide whether to consent. It lets implementers build compatible systems without guessing. It also enforces a crucial boundary: MESO publishes governance, not private life. That separation is what prevents "authority" from becoming surveillance.

### 3.6 MACRO: The Atlas

At the largest layer, we need the atlas. That is MACRO: stanspace.authority.nz. It is the public map of stans and concepts, with routing, comparisons, and consequence overlays. It makes understanding navigable infrastructure. It can show the next five stans someone needs, or where a debate's hidden prerequisites diverge, or where a policy's externalities land. It stays humane by being exportable, forkable, plural: a map you can take with you, not a priesthood you must obey.

## Level 4: Distillation

One line per section:

- **Stangraphics** makes understanding mappable.
- **Consequentialism** makes outcomes accountable.
- **Cognitive Fusion** makes intelligence a governed toolchain.
- **MICRO OI** makes governance executable in daily life.
- **MESO** makes governance public, stable, and verifiable.
- **MACRO** makes knowledge navigable, exportable, and humane.

The six sections form a single machine of meaning and responsibility:

1. Map what is required to understand.
2. Map what happens when you act.
3. Deliver intelligence through governed fusion, not raw authority.
4. Implement it as a MICRO OI with stop-wins and fail-closed gates.
5. Publish the rules at MESO so trust becomes checkable.
6. Publish the atlas at MACRO so understanding becomes accessible.

## Level 5: Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MICRO (make the smallest unit real)

Build the OI runtime:

- CIF ingress/egress
- CDI decision engine
- Capability tokens for every tool call
- Partitioned memory
- Minimal receipts
- Stop-wins interrupt path

Deliver as a local-first CLI + minimal app shell.

### Phase 2: MESO (publish the constitution)

Stand up meso.authority.nz as a signed artefact registry:

- Glossary (nested deac)
- Treaties/charters
- Schemas (OpenAPI/JSON Schema)
- Policy packs (CDI rules)
- Receipt templates
- Compatibility matrix
- Append-only ledger

Clients verify signatures, fail closed on mismatch.

### Phase 3: MACRO (ship the atlas)

Stand up stanspace.authority.nz as a graph service + static exports:

- Stans library
- Concept graph with reasons on edges
- Routing APIs: next stans, curricula, comparisons
- Crystal export/import
- Consequence overlays for policy topics

### Phase 4: Product Fusion (make it usable by humans)

UX shell:

- Triage, Mahi, Library, Explain, CareMode
- Low stimulus, no nagging, one-next-step defaults

Hardware path:

- Custody-first keys
- Physical or near-physical stop channel
- Local encrypted continuity capsule

### Phase 5: Proof via use

Measure:

- Reduced incident rates from gated actuation
- Faster learning via routed prerequisites
- Better outcomes via ledgered externalities
- User trust via verifiable MESO artefacts

Keep export sacred, keep stop-wins sacred, keep identity boundaries sacred.

## Conclusion

> The Sun can be the centre of a system by gravity... but a civilisation becomes the centre of its universe by consequence.

When understanding is mapped, consequence is ledgered, and action is gated by conscience and consent, intelligence stops being a crown and becomes care.
