title: "Collated Summation of the Six Sections"
summary: >
  Long-form compression of the entire six-part system into one coherent object.
  Unifies Stangraphics (map of understanding), Consequentialism (map of consequences),
  Cognitive Fusion (governed toolchain era), MICRO OI (executable governance),
  MESO authority (public constitution), and MACRO stanspace (navigable atlas).
  Core primitives: stan, graph, ledger, CIF, CDI, capability, receipt, stop-wins,
  fail-closed. The system closes the loop between knowledge and consequence.

claims:
  - "The system is coherent because it closes the loop between knowledge and consequence"
  - "The system is governable because every powerful move passes through explicit gates"
  - "The system scales because layers separate private life from public governance"
  - "The system avoids becoming a crown because export, refusal, and identity boundaries are first-class"
  - "Stangraphics makes understanding mappable"
  - "Consequentialism makes outcomes accountable"
  - "Cognitive Fusion makes intelligence a governed toolchain"
  - "MICRO OI makes governance executable in daily life"
  - "MESO makes governance public, stable, and verifiable"
  - "MACRO makes knowledge navigable, exportable, and humane"
  - "Stan is the unit of interpretive requirement"
  - "Graph is the explicit structure of concepts, prerequisites, and routes"
  - "Ledger is the explicit structure of consequences, stakeholders, and costs"
  - "When understanding is mapped, consequence is ledgered, and action is gated by conscience and consent, intelligence stops being a crown and becomes care"
tests_or_falsifiers:
  - name: Knowledge-consequence loop closure
    description: Stangraphics routes understanding and Consequentialism audits outcomes such that what-we-know and what-we-cause cannot drift apart silently
    falsification_condition: A path exists where knowledge changes without consequence audit or consequences occur without knowledge trace
  - name: Gate completeness
    description: Every powerful move passes through CIF, CDI, capability, receipt, and stop-wins gates
    falsification_condition: An actuation path bypasses any gate without explicit governance override
  - name: Layer separation
    description: MICRO holds private threads, MESO publishes governance without leaking privacy, MACRO publishes atlas without claiming monopoly
    falsification_condition: Private data leaks into MESO/MACRO, or MACRO content cannot be exported or forked
  - name: Anti-crown invariant
    description: Export, refusal, and identity boundaries are first-class; a single principal retains root authority
    falsification_condition: Lock-in enforced, fail-open behaviour observed, or hive-mind identity merging occurs
  - name: Six-section interlock
    description: All six sections form a single coherent machine of meaning and responsibility
    falsification_condition: A section can be removed without breaking the coherence of the remaining five
