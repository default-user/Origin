title: "GitHub Spider Integration Pack"
summary: >
  Evidence-only ingestion pack from PAT-less GitHub spider run against
  default-user owned public repositories. Extracts governance primitives
  from crystal-repl, mathison, OI, SGME, and cross-references with
  existing Origin corpus including lifeblood-cathedral (C0022).
