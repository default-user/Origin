title: "LFME: Language Facing Meaning Engine"
summary: >
  A compression architecture that transforms input text into #concept: #nothing: #1: ** chains
  at the data ingestion stage. LFME faces language and extracts meaning-bearing structures
  before storage, enabling deterministic decompression through Denotum's fractal tree.
