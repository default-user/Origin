title: "Stangraphics: The Science of Understanding as Navigation"
summary: >
  Stangraphics is the science that makes understanding mappable. A stan is the unit
  of interpretive requirement. Concepts are coordinates; learners move through a terrain
  made of requirements. Every cliff edge is a missing stan. Every argument is a collision
  of two stan-profiles. Every good teacher is a route planner. Stangraphics replaces
  shame with maps and turns learning into navigation with dignity. Includes
  god/physics/maths/ethics/philosophy framing as navigable module.

tests_or_falsifiers:
  - name: Stan as unit
    description: Stan is consistently used as the unit of interpretive requirement throughout
    falsification_condition: Stan used with a different or conflicting definition
  - name: Navigability
    description: Stangraphics content can be navigated coherently as a terrain of requirements
    falsification_condition: Navigation paths lead to dead ends or loops
  - name: Prerequisite mapping
    description: Missing understanding is traced to missing stans, not attributed to shame or stupidity
    falsification_condition: Failure to understand attributed to learner deficiency rather than prerequisite gap
  - name: Falsifier presence
    description: Claims in Stangraphics have corresponding falsifiers
    falsification_condition: Claims without any falsification criteria
  - name: Frame coverage
    description: All stated frames (god/physics/maths/ethics/philosophy) addressed
    falsification_condition: Frame mentioned but not addressed
