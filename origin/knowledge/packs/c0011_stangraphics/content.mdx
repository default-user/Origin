# Stangraphics: The Science of Understanding as Navigation

## Level 0: Summary

Stangraphics is the science that makes understanding mappable. A **stan** is the unit of interpretive requirement. Concepts are coordinates, and learners move through a terrain made of requirements. Every cliff edge is a missing stan. Every argument is a collision of two stan-profiles. Every good teacher is a route planner. Stangraphics replaces shame with maps and turns learning into navigation with dignity.

## Level 1: Core Definitions

### 1.1 What is a Stan?

A **stan** is the unit of interpretive requirement. It is the smallest nameable thing you need to understand before the next concept makes sense. Stans are not facts; they are requirements for comprehension.

### 1.2 What is Stangraphics?

Stangraphics is the science of mapping understanding. It treats:

| Element | Mapping |
|---------|---------|
| Concepts | Coordinates in a terrain |
| Learners | Agents moving through that terrain |
| Prerequisites | Paths and routes between coordinates |
| Missing understanding | Cliff edges (missing stans) |
| Arguments | Collisions of two stan-profiles |
| Teaching | Route planning |

### 1.3 The First Truth

Learning is not magic. Most "I don't get it" is not stupidity; it is missing prerequisites. Stangraphics names that truth and makes it drawable.

### 1.4 Multi-Frame Lens

Stangraphics also opens reality through multiple frames:

| Frame | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| God | Metaphysical, ultimate questions |
| Physics | Physical laws, empirical reality |
| Maths | Formal structures, logical truths |
| Ethics | Right action, value systems |
| Philosophy | Wisdom, integrated understanding |

## Level 2: Mechanics

### 2.1 Stan-Profiles

A stan-profile is the set of stans a person currently holds. Two people disagreeing may not have a values conflict; they may have a prerequisite mismatch. Stangraphics exposes this by comparing stan-profiles.

### 2.2 Graphs and Routes

A **graph** is the explicit structure of concepts, prerequisites, and routes. The graph makes visible:

- What stans are needed for a given concept
- What order to acquire them in
- Where alternative routes exist
- Where cliff edges (missing stans) block progress

### 2.3 Navigation, Not Judgement

Stangraphics replaces shame with maps. When someone fails to understand, the response is not "you are not smart enough" but "which stan is missing?" This turns education into navigation and preserves dignity.

### 2.4 Navigable Module

The requirement: represent Stangraphics as a navigable module with:

- Entry points per frame
- Cross-frame connections
- Falsifiers for claims
- Tests for coherence

## Level 3: Role in the Six Sections

### 3.1 Stangraphics + Consequentialism

Stangraphics gives the map of understanding. Consequentialism (see C0024) gives the map of consequences. When combined, "what we know" and "what we cause" cannot drift apart silently. Stangraphics is one half of the knowledge-consequence loop.

### 3.2 Stangraphics in MACRO

At the MACRO layer (stanspace.authority.nz), Stangraphics becomes the atlas: a public navigable universe of stans, concepts, and overlays. It can show the next five stans someone needs, where a debate's hidden prerequisites diverge, or where a policy's externalities land.

### 3.3 Distillation

**Stangraphics makes understanding mappable.**

---

## Level 4: Falsifiers

### 4.1 Internal Consistency

Each frame must not contradict itself.

Falsification: Internal contradiction detected.

### 4.2 Cross-Frame Coherence

Frames should be compatible where they overlap.

Falsification: Irreconcilable contradiction between frames.

### 4.3 Stan Integrity

Every stan must be a genuine prerequisite, not a gatekeeper.

Falsification: A stan is required that does not actually enable comprehension of the next concept.

### 4.4 Navigability

All paths should lead somewhere meaningful.

Falsification: Dead ends or infinite loops.
