## Level 0: Summary

Stangraphics is a lens that "opens reality" through god/physics/maths/ethics/philosophy framing. It's represented as a navigable module with falsifiers and tests. Formal definitions may be [UNKNOWN].

---

## Level 1: Stangraphics Concept

### 1.1 What is Stangraphics?

A conceptual lens for examining reality through multiple frames:

| Frame | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| God | Metaphysical, ultimate questions |
| Physics | Physical laws, empirical reality |
| Maths | Formal structures, logical truths |
| Ethics | Right action, value systems |
| Philosophy | Wisdom, integrated understanding |

### 1.2 As a Lens

Stangraphics doesn't claim to BE reality but provides a way to VIEW reality:
- Multi-perspective examination
- Frame-switching capability
- Integration across domains

### 1.3 Navigable Module

The requirement: represent as navigable module with:
- Entry points per frame
- Cross-frame connections
- Falsifiers for claims
- Tests for coherence

---

## Level 2: Frame Exploration

### 2.1 God Frame

Questions of ultimate reality, first causes, meaning beyond physics.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific positions or claims.

### 2.2 Physics Frame

Empirical laws, measurable phenomena, material causation.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific physical theories referenced.

### 2.3 Maths Frame

Formal structures, proof, logical necessity, abstract patterns.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific mathematical frameworks.

### 2.4 Ethics Frame

Value systems, right action, moral reasoning.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific ethical positions.

### 2.5 Philosophy Frame

Integration of all frames, wisdom, comprehensive understanding.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific philosophical systems.

---

## Level 3: Falsifiers

### 3.1 Internal Consistency

Each frame must not contradict itself.

Falsification: Internal contradiction detected.

### 3.2 Cross-Frame Coherence

Frames should be compatible where they overlap.

Falsification: Irreconcilable contradiction between frames.

### 3.3 Navigability

All paths should lead somewhere meaningful.

Falsification: Dead ends or infinite loops.

## Unknowns

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Formal definition of Stangraphics.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Specific content for each frame.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Mathematical formalization.
