## Level 0: Summary

MCL (Meta Control Language) describes meta-control over branched execution stacks. When MCL binds meta-control in this way, it can resemble consciousness-like control in bots. MCL is designed to be safe, secure, and ethically bound.

> **Constraint**: Conceptual seed. Does not claim solved singularities.

## Level 1: Core Concepts

### 1.1 What is Meta-Control?

Control over control mechanisms:
- Not just actions, but policies about actions
- Not just decisions, but governance of decisions
- Not just execution, but oversight of execution

### 1.2 Consciousness-Like Properties

When a system has:
1. Awareness of its execution state
2. Control over its control mechanisms
3. Ability to reflect and modify behavior

...it exhibits properties that *resemble* consciousness functionally.

### 1.3 Safety, Security, Ethics

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Bounded operation, fail-safes |
| **Security** | Access control, integrity |
| **Ethics** | Value alignment, harm prevention |

## Level 2: MCL Structure

### 2.1 Core Constructs

```mcl
context MainExecution {
  type: primary
  monitoring: enabled
}

policy ResourceGovernance {
  applies_to: MainExecution
  rules { memory_limit: 1GB }
}

meta_policy PolicyGovernance {
  applies_to: [ResourceGovernance]
  rules { policy_changes: require_approval }
}

ethical_binding CoreEthics {
  applies_to: ALL
  constraints { harm_prevention: mandatory }
  violation_response: immediate_halt
}
```

### 2.2 Branched Stack Control

MCL manages multiple execution branches:
- Fork: Create parallel paths
- Merge: Unify results
- Govern: Apply policies across all branches
- Meta-govern: Policies about policies

---

## Level 3: Integration

### 3.1 MCL + Kāti (C0009)

MCL provides language; Kāti provides architecture:
- MCL expressions → Kāti enforcement
- Result: Bounded, governed execution

### 3.2 MCL + CIF/CDI (C0013)

- CIF boundaries respected by MCL contexts
- CDI decisions route through MCL ethical bindings
