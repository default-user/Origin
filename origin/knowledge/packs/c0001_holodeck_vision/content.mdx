## Level 0: Summary

The Holodeck Vision describes an immersive system where users experience environments from within (first-person) while maintaining access to external views (God's-eye). The canonical example: playing Pac-Man AS Pac-Man, with a hovering map view like the player UI.

> "Intentionally funny and viral in framing, but containing a serious build spec."

## Level 1: Core Vision

### 1.1 The Key Image

Imagine playing Pac-Man — but you ARE Pac-Man. You're in the maze, the walls tower around you, and pellets glow at knee height. Ghosts aren't cute sprites; they're entities you see coming down the corridor.

But you also have access to the classic view: a translucent map hovers in your peripheral vision, showing the whole maze, your position, and the ghosts. The best of both worlds.

### 1.2 Full Circle Claim

> "Full circle if Pac-Man becomes #1 game again" in this new medium.

Classic games could be revitalized through holodeck experiences, creating a cultural loop where the oldest games become the newest innovations.

### 1.3 Dual Perspective System

| View | Experience | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| First-person | Immersed in the maze | Presence, engagement |
| God's-eye | Overhead map view | Strategy, awareness |
| Hybrid | Both simultaneously | Complete experience |

## Level 2: Build Specification

### 2.1 Module Architecture

```
HOLODECK SYSTEM
├── Render Engine (visual projection)
├── Physics Engine (movement, collision)
├── World State (canonical game state)
├── Haptics System (physical feedback)
├── Audio System (spatial sound)
├── View Controller (perspective switching)
└── Safety Systems (boundaries, health, override)
```

### 2.2 Safety Requirements

The holodeck must be safe:

- **Physical boundaries**: Soft walls, haptic warnings
- **User health monitoring**: Heart rate, motion sickness detection
- **Emergency stop**: Voice command, physical button, auto-detect
- **Graceful degradation**: Reduce intensity before failure

### 2.3 Staging Plan

1. Visual prototype (static scenes)
2. View switching (first-person ↔ God's-eye)
3. Interaction (user affects environment)
4. Game integration (Pac-Man playable)
5. Overlay system (mini-map works)
6. Haptics (physical feedback)
7. Safety validation
8. Full integration

### 2.4 Failure Modes

| Failure | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Render failure | Fade to safe room |
| Tracking loss | Freeze, audio alert |
| User distress | De-immersion, exit |
| System overload | Reduce fidelity |

## Level 3: Worked Scenario

### Session: Pac-Man Holodeck

1. **Entry**: User enters chamber, safety calibrates
2. **Start**: Maze materializes, user is Pac-Man
3. **Gameplay**: Walk corridors, collect dots (glowing orbs)
4. **Map**: Hover map shows ghost positions
5. **Chase**: Ghost approaches — visible ahead AND on map
6. **Power-up**: Collect pellet, chase ghosts
7. **End**: Score displayed, graceful de-immersion
