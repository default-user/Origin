# Anti-Mumbo Filter Seed

## Level 0: Summary

The Anti-Mumbo Filter clarifies unclear text and produces clean canonical versions. Workflow: detect unclear spans, mark unknowns, propose corrections, preserve originals. Treated as capability/spec.

---

## Level 1: Core Concept

### 1.1 What is "Mumbo"?

"Mumbo" (as in mumbo-jumbo) refers to:
- Unclear or undefined terms
- Vague or ambiguous statements
- Jargon without explanation
- Circular definitions

### 1.2 The Anti-Mumbo Filter

A tool-like workflow to:
1. **Detect** unclear spans in text
2. **Mark** unknowns explicitly
3. **Propose** clarifications or corrections
4. **Preserve** original text for reference

### 1.3 Purpose

```
Mumbo Input → Anti-Mumbo Filter → Clear Output
                    │
                    └→ Original preserved
```

The goal: clarity without loss.

## Level 2: Workflow

### 2.1 Detection Phase

Identify problematic patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Undefined term | "The fluxor initiates" (what's a fluxor?) |
| Vague claim | "It sort of works somehow" |
| Circular definition | "X is defined as X-like" |
| Unexplained jargon | "Apply the QWERTY transform" |

### 2.2 Marking Phase

Mark detected issues:

```markdown
Original: "The fluxor initiates the cascade"
Marked:   "The [UNCLEAR: fluxor] initiates the cascade"
```

For completely unknown items:
```markdown
[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS]
```

### 2.3 Proposal Phase

Suggest clarifications:

```markdown
Proposal: "The [fluxor → flux controller] initiates the cascade"
```

Or request definition:
```markdown
Proposal: "The fluxor [NEEDS DEFINITION] initiates the cascade"
```

### 2.4 Preservation Phase

Keep originals:

```markdown
## Canonical Version
The flux controller initiates the cascade.

## Original Version (preserved)
The fluxor initiates the cascade.

## Changes
- "fluxor" → "flux controller" (defined in glossary)
```

## Level 3: Integration

### 3.1 With Kāti (C0009)

Kāti's "clarity" principle uses Anti-Mumbo:
- All Kāti terms must pass filter
- No undefined terms in governance

### 3.2 With Documentation (C0003)

Fractal documentation uses Anti-Mumbo:
- Each level must be clear
- Unknowns marked explicitly
- No hidden confusion

### 3.3 As Capability/Spec

> Keep as capability/spec, not OCR claims.

The Anti-Mumbo Filter is specified as a capability. Claims about OCR or other input processing are not made unless real input exists.
