## Level 0: Summary

Orgasystem is a universe framing / generative unity metaphor. It must be explained in culturally careful terms with English gloss and explicit definitions. Metaphor vs claim must be clearly marked. The universal unity equation specifics are [UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS].

---

## Level 1: Orgasystem Concept

### 1.1 What is Orgasystem?

**Note**: The following is METAPHOR, not literal claim.

Orgasystem is a framing that views the universe as:
- **Organic**: Living, growing, interconnected
- **Systematic**: Patterned, structured, lawful
- **Generative**: Creative, producing novelty
- **Unified**: Coherent whole, not mere parts

### 1.2 As Metaphor

### 1.3 Cultural Care

This concept touches on areas with cultural/spiritual significance. Approach:
- Explicit definitions over assumed meanings
- English gloss for all terms
- Respect without appropriation
- Metaphor clearly marked

---

## Level 2: Framework Elements

### 2.1 The Name

"Orgasystem" combines:
- **Orga-**: From "organic" — living, natural
- **-system**: Structured whole, interrelated parts

English gloss: "The universe viewed as a living, organized whole."

### 2.2 Generative Unity

The "generative unity" aspect suggests:
- Unity: Fundamental coherence
- Generative: Productive of new forms

**As metaphor**: Viewing the universe as creative rather than mechanical.

**Not claimed**: That this is literally true in any provable sense.

### 2.3 The Formula

> [UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Universal unity equation specifics.

The canonical corpus mentions a "universal unity equation" but does not provide specifics. This remains [UNKNOWN] and is not fabricated.

---

## Level 3: Boundaries

### 3.1 What This IS

- A conceptual framing
- A metaphor for understanding
- A perspective or lens
- A documented concept in ORIGIN

### 3.2 What This IS NOT

- A religious claim
- A scientific theory (in formal sense)
- A cultural appropriation
- A literal ontological assertion

### 3.3 Falsifiers

| Test | Falsification |
|------|---------------|
| Metaphor clarity | Metaphor presented as literal truth |
| No fabrication | Equation details invented |
| Cultural respect | Sacred claims made inappropriately |
