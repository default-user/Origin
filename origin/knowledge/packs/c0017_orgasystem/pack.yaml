title: Orgasystem Seed
summary: >
  Orgasystem is a universe framing / generative unity metaphor. The universal unity
  equation U ≡ ∫G(U) expresses how unity generates multiplicity which integrates back
  to enriched unity. Formula explained in culturally careful terms with English gloss
  and explicit definitions. Metaphor vs claim clearly marked.

tests_or_falsifiers:
  - name: Metaphor distinction
    description: Metaphors clearly distinguished from claims
    falsification_condition: Metaphor presented as literal claim
  - name: Derivation validity
    description: Equation must trace to corpus patterns
    falsification_condition: Equation not derivable from Denotum, Stangraphics, etc.
  - name: Cultural care
    description: Terms explained respectfully without sacred/cultural claims
    falsification_condition: Inappropriate cultural claims made
  - name: Frame coverage
    description: Equation viewable through all 5 Stangraphics frames
    falsification_condition: One of the five frames cannot accommodate the equation
  - name: Self-consistency
    description: Equation must not contradict source patterns
    falsification_condition: Contradiction found with Denotum, Stangraphics, etc.
