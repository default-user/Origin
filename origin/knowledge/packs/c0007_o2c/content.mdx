# O2C: Ultimate Archive and Dummie's Guide

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

O2C is an "ark/arc capsule for all time" — a complete archive with narrative, ethical roots, and system blueprints. It provides both accessible ("for Dummies") and comprehensive ("Ultimate Archive") paths through the same material.

---

## Level 1: O2C Concept

### 1.1 The Dual Nature

| Level | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Archive | O2C Ultimate | Complete, technical |
| Guide | O2C for Dummies | Accessible, narrative |

### 1.2 Ark/Arc Framing

**Ark**: Vessel preserving knowledge through time
- Self-contained
- Self-documenting
- Survives context loss

**Arc**: Trajectory of understanding
- From novice to expert
- From confusion to clarity
- From seed to maturity

### 1.3 Required Components

```
O2C
├── Narrative Layer (why this exists)
├── Ethical Root (foundational values)
├── System Blueprint (architecture)
├── Code Layer (working implementations)
└── Documentation (fractal explanations)
```

---

## Level 2: O2C for Dummies

### 2.1 What is O2C?

Imagine putting everything important into a time capsule:
- Not just facts, but why they matter
- Not just data, but how to understand it
- Not just code, but how to run it
- The capsule explains itself

### 2.2 How to Use It

1. **Start here**: Read narrative overview
2. **Go deeper**: Follow fractal links
3. **Get practical**: Use code examples
4. **Verify**: Check claims against tests

O2C System
├── Knowledge Store (packs)
├── Index System (dist/*.json)
├── Validation Layer (schema)
