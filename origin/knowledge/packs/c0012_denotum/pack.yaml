title: "Denotum: The Fractal Tree of Meaning"
summary: >
  Denotum is a branching fractalised tree from conceptualisation at root.
  A meaning-compression system that structures how concepts branch, compress,
  and unfurl. Conceptualisation at root; Denotum as trunk and branches;
  Fractal Unfurling as the visible canopy.
