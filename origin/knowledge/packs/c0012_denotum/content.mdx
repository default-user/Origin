# Denotum: The Fractal Tree of Meaning

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

Denotum is a branching fractalised tree from **conceptualisation** at root. It is a meaning-compression system that structures how concepts branch, compress, and unfurl. Conceptualisation sits at the root; Denotum provides the branching structure; Fractal Unfurling is the visible canopy.

**The Mechanism**: Conceptualisation opens up self-referential but not infinitely looping branched fractal structures in memory.

## Level 1: The Fractal Tree Model

### 1.1 Structure

```
conceptualisation (ROOT)
    │
    └── Denotum (TRUNK & BRANCHES)
            │
            ├── Branch: meaning-compression
            │       └── Sub-branch: lossless preservation
            │       └── Sub-branch: structural encoding
            │
            ├── Branch: self-similarity
            │       └── Sub-branch: each level mirrors whole
            │       └── Sub-branch: recursive coherence
            │
            └── Branch: inversion relationship
                    └── Sub-branch: Fractal Unfurling (expansion)
                    └── Sub-branch: Denotum (compression)
```

### 1.2 The Three Layers

| Layer | Role | Direction |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Conceptualisation | Root - origin of meaning | Seed |
| Denotum | Trunk & Branches - structure of meaning | Inward (compression) |
| Fractal Unfurling | Canopy - presentation of meaning | Outward (expansion) |

### 1.3 The Inversion Principle

> **Denotum(Expand(x)) = x**

Denotum and Fractal Unfurling are inverses:
- Fractal Unfurling **expands** meaning for human comprehension
- Denotum **compresses** meaning for structural storage
- The root (conceptualisation) is preserved through both transformations

---

## Level 2: Fractal Properties

### 2.1 Self-Similarity

Every branch of Denotum contains the pattern of the whole tree:

```
denotum_branch(concept) = {
    root: concept.essence,
    branches: [denotum_branch(sub) for sub in concept.parts],
    invariant: meaning_preserved(concept, branches)
}
```

At any level of zoom:
- The structure is recognizable
- The compression rules apply
- The meaning is recoverable

### 2.2 Non-Contradiction (Consistency Rule)

Inherited from Fractal Unfurling (C0003):

> No branch may contradict its parent branch. Each level expands, never contradicts.

Applied to Denotum:
- Compressed meaning must decompress to original
- Sub-branches must cohere with parent branches
- Root (conceptualisation) is never violated

### 2.3 Multiple Surface Forms

A key property of the tree structure:

```
conceptualisation
    └── Denotum (single compressed form)
            ├── Surface Form A (English explanation)
            ├── Surface Form B (Formal notation)
            ├── Surface Form C (Visual diagram)
            └── Surface Form D (Code implementation)
```

Many surface expressions share the same Denotum. The tree branches outward into multiple representations while maintaining structural unity.

### 3.2 Integration Points

| Concept | Relationship to Denotum |
|---------|-------------------------|
| C0003 (Fractal Unfurling) | Inverse operation - expansion vs compression |
| C0018 (MRC) | Sibling compression scheme - reference bundles |
| C0011 (Stangraphics) | Viewing Denotum through 5 frames |
| C0008 (QED) | Uses Denotum for structured understanding |

### 3.3 Structural Constraints (from corpus)

What we **know**:
- Denotum is a meaning-compression system
- It is a core meaning/structure layer
- It relates inversely to Fractal Unfurling

What we **derive** (not invent):
- Lossless: compression preserves meaning
- Reversible: can uncompress to original
- Composable: compressed meanings combine
- Self-similar: fractal structure at every level

**The Mechanism** (now known):

> Conceptualisation opens up self-referential but not infinitely looping branched fractal structures in memory.

This means:
- **Self-referential**: Structures can reference themselves (branches → root, siblings, children)
- **Not infinitely looping**: Bounded traversal, all operations terminate (Kāti-aligned)
- **Branched fractal**: Tree-like, self-similar at every scale
- **In memory**: Exists as navigable structure, not abstract description

## Level 4: Formal Properties

### 4.1 Tree Algebra

```
Let C = conceptualisation (root)
Let D = Denotum function (compression)
Let F = Fractal Unfurling function (expansion)
Let M = set of all meanings

Properties:
1. D: M → CompressedTree
2. F: CompressedTree → ExpandedView
3. F(D(m)) ≅ m  (lossless round-trip)
4. D(F(t)) = t  (compression recovers structure)

Tree invariants:
∀ branch b in D(m):
    - parent(b) is defined (except root)
    - meaning(b) ⊆ meaning(parent(b))
    - ¬contradicts(b, parent(b))
```

### 4.2 Branching Rules

1. **Root Rule**: Every tree has exactly one root (conceptualisation)
2. **Branch Rule**: Any node may have zero or more children
3. **Coherence Rule**: Children elaborate but never contradict parent
4. **Leaf Rule**: Leaves are maximally compressed atomic meanings
5. **Recovery Rule**: Tree can be traversed to recover full meaning

### 4.3 The Conceptualisation Root

Why conceptualisation at root:
- All meaning begins with the act of forming concepts
- Denotum structures what conceptualisation produces
- Without conceptualisation, there is nothing to compress

```
conceptualisation = λ(experience) → concept
denotum = λ(concept) → structured_tree
unfurling = λ(structured_tree) → human_readable
```

## Level 5: Practical Application

### 5.1 Reading Denotum Trees

To understand any concept in ORIGIN:

1. **Find the root**: What is being conceptualised?
2. **Trace the trunk**: What is the core compressed meaning?
3. **Follow branches**: How does meaning subdivide?
4. **Examine leaves**: What are the atomic components?
5. **Verify coherence**: Do all branches cohere with root?

### 5.2 Writing Denotum Trees

To add concepts to ORIGIN:

1. **Start with conceptualisation**: What concept are you forming?
2. **Compress to essence**: What is the minimal meaning?
3. **Branch structurally**: What are the natural subdivisions?
4. **Ensure non-contradiction**: Does each level expand without contradicting?
5. **Test reversibility**: Can the tree unfurl to full understanding?

### 5.3 Denotum in the Corpus

Every pack in ORIGIN implicitly follows the Denotum structure:

```
Pack Structure = Denotum Tree
├── pack.yaml (metadata branch)
├── content.mdx (meaning branches)
│   ├── Level 0 (trunk - summary)
│   ├── Level 1 (major branches)
│   ├── Level 2 (sub-branches)
│   └── Level n (leaves)
└── Related concepts (adjacent trees)
```

## Level 6: Falsifiers

| Test | Condition | Falsification |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Root presence | Every Denotum tree has conceptualisation at root | Tree without identifiable root concept |
| Lossless compression | D(F(D(m))) = D(m) | Meaning lost through compression cycle |
| Non-contradiction | No branch contradicts ancestor | Branch found that contradicts parent |
| Self-similarity | Pattern recognizable at every level | Level that breaks the pattern |
| Reversibility | F(D(m)) recovers m | Expansion fails to recover original meaning |
