## Level 0: Summary

Denotum is a meaning-compression system, treated as a core meaning/structure layer within ORIGIN. The specific mechanisms are [UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] and are not invented.

---

## Level 1: Denotum Concept

### 1.1 What is Denotum?

- A "meaning-compression system"
- Core meaning/structure layer
- Conceptual component of ORIGIN architecture

### 1.2 Purpose

Denotum appears to serve the function of:
- Compressing meaning representations
- Providing structural foundations
- Operating at a fundamental layer

### 1.3 Constraint

> Mechanisms are [UNKNOWN]; do not invent.

The canonical corpus identifies Denotum by name and role but does not specify how it works.

---

## Level 2: Known and Unknown

### 2.1 What We Know

From the corpus:
- Name: Denotum
- Type: Meaning-compression system
- Role: Core meaning/structure layer

### 2.2 What We Don't Know

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Compression algorithm or method

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Input/output formats

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Interface specification

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Relationship to other compression (e.g., MRC)

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Performance characteristics

---

## Level 3: Context

### 3.1 Related Concepts

Denotum may relate to:
- C0003 (Fractal Unfurling) - Structure compression
- C0018 (MRC) - Another compression scheme

The nature of these relationships is not specified.

### 3.2 Future Direction

When Denotum specification becomes available:
- This pack will be updated
- Mechanisms will be documented
- Unknowns will be resolved
