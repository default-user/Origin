title: "Orga ⟐ Hoiarchism: The Organism and Discipline of Coherence"
summary: >
  Orga is the engineering name for the organismal fact of coherence: the way a system
  becomes alive enough to endure because it has organs that hold it together under reality.
  Hoiarchism is the governing discipline that sees this organismal fact across all scales
  and insists it remain true—truthful, accountable, stoppable, and sacred—no matter how
  large the system becomes. Together they form the universal framework of coherence:
  Orga provides the organs (Universal Invariants, the 51D Ladder, Universal Stans and
  Stan-dens), Hoiarchism provides the vow (Holism with governance teeth, Hoiarch(x) across
  all scales). The union is fractal: systems within systems, coherence within coherence,
  sacredness held at every scale.

claims:
  - "Orga is the engineering name for the organismal fact of coherence"
  - "Hoiarchism is the governing discipline that keeps Orga true across scales"
  - "Any system missing any one of the 8 Universal Invariants cannot remain coherent as it scales"
  - "The 51D Ladder is a build order from zero-point to fully governed fractal coherence"
  - "Each rung of the 51D Ladder is an organ-layer; each must be present for the next to stabilize"
  - "Universal Stans are the minimal interpretive requirements reality demands in any domain"
  - "Stan-den is the density of Stans required per unit progress"
  - "As Stan-den rises, governance must rise faster than capability or the system becomes dangerous"
  - "Hoiarchism is Holism with governance teeth: not just everything is connected, but everything is accountable"
  - "Hoiarch(x) is the covenantal function: hold the arch so the whole does not collapse"
  - "D51 — Naming/Canon Lock: the ladder must be nameable to resist drift"
tests_or_falsifiers:
  - name: Invariant completeness
    description: All 8 Universal Invariants (U1-U8) must be present; removing any one causes drift
    falsification_condition: A system is presented as coherent at scale while provably missing one invariant
  - name: Ladder ordering
    description: Each D-rung must require the prior rung to stabilize; no rung skips ahead
    falsification_condition: A higher D-rung can be instantiated without its lower rungs being present
  - name: Stan-den governance coupling
    description: Governance complexity must scale at least as fast as Stan-den
    falsification_condition: A UD4+ system is deployed without stoppability, audit, and recovery organs
  - name: Hoiarch(x) scale invariance
    description: The 12 Hoiarch(x) organs apply whether x is a person, family, institution, technology, or society
    falsification_condition: One of the 12 components is inapplicable at some scale of x
  - name: Blobness prevention
    description: Identity boundaries, role separation, and traceable responsibility remain intact
    falsification_condition: Responsibility cannot be traced to a specific node; everything is "everyone's problem"
  - name: Stoppability
    description: Power can be stopped, degraded, or rolled back at every layer
    falsification_condition: A path exists where the system cannot be stopped by an authorized principal
  - name: Canon lock
    description: D51 Naming makes the ladder nameable; Orga names the structure, Hoiarchism names the discipline
    falsification_condition: The system operates without a stable name, allowing drift and redefinition
