# CIF/CDI Disambiguation Seed

## Level 0: Summary

CIF (Context Integrity Firewall) is the ingress/egress integrity boundary. CDI (Conscience Decision Interface) is the kernel judge for allow/deny/transform/degrade decisions. These governance-critical terms must never be blurred or confused.

---

## Level 1: Term Definitions

### 1.1 CIF — Context Integrity Firewall

**Definition**: Ingress/egress integrity boundary

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Role | Guard data/context boundaries |
| Function | Verify integrity at entry/exit |
| Scope | Ingress (coming in) + egress (going out) |
| Purpose | Prevent integrity violations |

### 1.2 CDI — Conscience Decision Interface

**Definition**: Kernel judge for allow/deny/transform/degrade

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Role | Make governance decisions |
| Function | Judge requests against policies |
| Options | Allow, Deny, Transform, Degrade |
| Purpose | Ethical/policy enforcement |

### 1.3 Critical Distinction

```
CIF: "Is this data/context valid and intact?"
     → Integrity check at boundary

CDI: "Should this action proceed?"
     → Decision based on conscience/policy
```

## Level 2: Functional Details

### 2.1 CIF Operations

```
INGRESS                    EGRESS
   │                          │
   ▼                          ▼
┌─────────┐              ┌─────────┐
│  CIF    │              │  CIF    │
│ Verify  │              │ Verify  │
│ Inbound │              │ Outbound│
└────┬────┘              └────┬────┘
     │                        │
     ▼                        ▼
 [PASS/FAIL]             [PASS/FAIL]
```

CIF checks:
- Data integrity
- Context validity
- Boundary compliance

### 2.2 CDI Operations

```
Request
   │
   ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│      CDI        │
│  Kernel Judge   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┼────┬────────┐
    ▼    ▼    ▼        ▼
 ALLOW  DENY  TRANSFORM DEGRADE
```

CDI decisions:
- **Allow**: Proceed as requested
- **Deny**: Block entirely
- **Transform**: Modify to acceptable form
- **Degrade**: Proceed with reduced capability

### 2.3 Integration

```
Input → CIF (integrity check) → CDI (decision) → Action
                                      │
                                      └→ CIF (egress check) → Output
```

CIF and CDI work together but are distinct:
- CIF: Is it valid?
- CDI: Is it allowed?

## Level 3: Governance Context

### 3.1 Why Disambiguation Matters

Blurring CIF/CDI leads to:
- Security holes (integrity vs. policy confusion)
- Governance failures (wrong checks at wrong times)
- Architecture degradation (unclear boundaries)

### 3.2 Relationship to Other Concepts

- **C0002 (MCL)**: MCL contexts respect CIF boundaries
- **C0009 (Kāti)**: Kāti governance includes CIF/CDI
- **C0006 (Privacy)**: CDI enforces privacy decisions
