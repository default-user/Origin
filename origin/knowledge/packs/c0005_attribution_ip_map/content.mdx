# Attribution + IP Map

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

All intellectual property in ORIGIN is attributed. The default authorship line is "Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)". Every concept traces its provenance, initially to "master_prompt" as the source.

---

## Level 1: Attribution System

### 1.1 The Default Line

```
Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)
```

This line appears on:
- Every document
- Every pack
- Every rendered page
- Every export

### 1.2 Provenance Tracking

Each pack records where its content came from:

```yaml
provenance:
  - type: master_prompt
    ref: "ORIGIN canonical corpus - C####"
```

Types of provenance:
- `master_prompt`: From the canonical corpus
- `document`: From external document
- `conversation`: From dialogue
- `derived`: Synthesized from other packs
- `external`: From outside sources

### 1.3 IP Map Structure

```
ORIGIN IP Map
├── Concept Packs (C0001-C0020)
│   └── Each with authorship + provenance
├── Documentation
│   └── Each with attribution line
├── Code/Tools
│   └── Each with header attribution
└── Exports/Archives
    └── Each with manifest attribution
```

---

## Level 2: Implementation

### 2.1 Pack Schema Requirements

From `schema/pack.schema.json`:

```json
{
  "authorship": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)"
  },
  "provenance": {
    "type": "array",
    "minItems": 1,
    "items": {
      "required": ["type", "ref"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.2 Attribution UI (Medusa)

The Attribution tendril displays:
- Default attribution line
- Per-pack overrides (if any)
- Provenance visualization
- Authorship explanation

### 2.3 Override Protocol

To use non-default attribution:
1. Document reason in pack.yaml
2. Include original attribution in provenance chain
3. New attribution must still be valid/accurate

---

## Level 3: Verification

### 3.1 Validation Checks

The validate tool checks:
- `authorship` field is present
- `provenance` array has ≥1 entry
- Each provenance entry has `type` and `ref`

### 3.2 Export Inclusion

All exports include:
- MANIFEST.json with global attribution
- Per-file attribution where applicable
