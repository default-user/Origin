title: "Lifeblood-Cathedral: Governed Gateway Integration"
summary: >
  Evidence-only integration of the lifeblood-cathedral project: a governed
  LLM gateway with capability gating, posture management, ledger/receipt
  pattern, and constitutional invariants. Includes DICTUNI symbol dictionary.

claims:
  - "Lifeblood = proxy/gateway to any LLM provider"
  - "Cathedral = governance backend: capability gating, posture, boundaries, ledger, receipts, watcher"
  - "Go implementation is 'tiny trusted core' and source-of-truth behavior"
  - "Parallel scaffolds exist in TS/Python/Rust/Java/.NET mirroring protocol/invariants"
  - "Protocol definitions: OpenAPI + JSON Schemas"
  - "Constitution invariants include: stop_wins_always, single_gateway_for_io, caps_required_for_privileged_ops"
  - "Degrade-on-uncertainty is an explicit invariant"
  - "Pre-intent and post-receipt logging required"
  - "No self-replication invariant"
