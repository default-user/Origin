## Level 0: Summary

Kāti (from Te Reo Māori: to block, stop, shut) is a core architecture pattern focused on governance and "stop-wins" — knowing when to stop, bounding operations, and maintaining clarity. Kāti uses version management (v1 → v2) and integrates with H (C0010).

---

## Level 1: Core Principles

### 1.1 What is Kāti?

Architecture pattern for:
- **Governance**: Rules about rules
- **Stop-wins**: Knowing when to stop
- **Bounded operation**: Explicit limits
- **Clarity**: Anti-mumbo commitment

### 1.2 Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Bounded | All operations have bounds |
| Observable | State is visible, auditable |
| Stoppable | Any operation can halt safely |
| Clear | No undefined terms |
| Versioned | v1 → v2 management |

### 1.3 Stop-Wins Concept

1. Define "winning" before starting
2. Define "too far" boundaries
3. Build in stop mechanisms
4. Celebrate stopping at the right time

---

## Level 2: Architecture

### 2.1 Kāti Structure

```
KĀTI
├── Boundary Layer (resource, time, scope, authority)
├── Governance Layer (policies, enforcement, meta-governance)
├── Observation Layer (monitoring, audit, anomaly, health)
├── Stop Layer (graceful, emergency, scheduled, conditional)
└── Clarity Layer (definitions, anti-mumbo, docs, explanations)
```

### 2.2 Version Management

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v1 | Target | QED has full knowledge |
| v2 | Planned | H integration |

### 2.3 Novice → Expert Path

| Level | Understanding |
|-------|---------------|
| Novice | "Kāti helps systems know when to stop" |
| Intermediate | Governance layers, boundary types |
| Advanced | Policy composition, meta-governance |
| Expert | Extension, v1→v2 migration, H integration |

---

## Level 3: Integration

### 3.1 Kāti + MCL (C0002)

MCL provides language; Kāti provides architecture.

### 3.2 Kāti + H (C0010)

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Detailed integration spec.

Conceptual: H operates within Kāti governance.

### 3.3 Kāti + QED (C0008)

QED targets "full knowledge of Kāti v1".

---

## Unknowns

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Complete Kāti v1 formal specification.

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Kāti v2 specification with H integration.
