## Level 0: Summary

Pac-Man serves as an example to explain evolution in narrative form, with a "bifurcation theory" vibe. Reader-friendly narratives tie into the Holodeck arc (C0001).

---

## Level 1: The Pac-Man Evolution Narrative

### 1.1 Once Upon a Time...

In 1980, a yellow circle with a mouth was born in Japan. Pac-Man was simple: eat dots, avoid ghosts, survive. The player watched from above, omniscient, controlling a creature in a maze.

Millions played. Pac-Man became an icon.

### 1.2 The Bifurcation

Time passed. Games evolved. 3D arrived. VR emerged. And now...

**The Fork**:
- Path A: Pac-Man stays 2D, a nostalgic classic
- Path B: Pac-Man enters the holodeck

What happens when you ARE Pac-Man?

### 1.3 Full Circle

> "Full circle if Pac-Man becomes #1 game again" in the new medium.

The oldest game could become the newest experience. Evolution completes a loop.

## Level 2: Bifurcation Theory (Conceptual)

### 2.1 What is Bifurcation?

In systems theory, bifurcation is a point where a system's behavior can diverge into different paths based on conditions.

```
        ┌─→ Path A (stable state 1)
System ─┤
        └─→ Path B (stable state 2)
             ↑
       Bifurcation point
```

### 2.2 Pac-Man Bifurcation

The bifurcation point for games:
- **Before**: Player outside, looking in
- **After**: Player inside, looking around

Pac-Man represents this perfectly:
- Classic: Watch the maze from above
- Holodeck: Walk the maze from within

### 2.3 Evolution Pattern

```
1980: Arcade (2D, external view)
   ↓
1990s: Console ports (same paradigm)
   ↓
2000s: 3D versions (external view, 3D graphics)
   ↓
2020s: VR experiments (first-person, limited)
   ↓
Future: Holodeck (true embodiment + God's-eye overlay)
   ↓
Full Circle: Pac-Man #1 again
```

## Level 3: Holodeck Connection

### 3.1 Link to C0001

This narrative ties directly to the Holodeck Vision (C0001):
- Pac-Man is THE canonical example
- First-person + God's-eye dual view
- "Full circle" claim originates here

### 3.2 The Narrative Purpose

Why use Pac-Man for evolution narrative?
- Universal recognition
- Simple mechanics (eat dots, avoid ghosts)
- Clear contrast between old and new paradigms
- Emotionally resonant "coming home"

### 3.3 Bifurcation Details

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Formal bifurcation theory application details.

The "bifurcation theory vibe" is conceptual. Specific mathematical formalism is not provided in the canonical corpus.
