# H / Haiku-Based OI Seed — MICRO Governance Frame

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

H is a Haiku-based / Haiku-Claude-OI style instance that integrates with Kāti in a version bump (v1 → v2). As MICRO in the six-section collation, the OI is the smallest living unit: thread-tending intelligence under a single human principal with partitioned memory, capability-gated actuation, stop-wins interrupt path, and fail-closed gates. Not a model but a governed system around models. MICRO is where ethics becomes literal execution rules.

---

## Level 1: H as OI Instance

### 1.1 What is H?

H represents:
- A "Haiku-based" instance
- "Haiku-Claude-OI" style
- Designed for Kāti integration

### 1.2 Kāti Integration

H integrates with Kāti architecture:
- v1: Kāti operates independently
- v2: H integrates with Kāti

The version bump enables H capabilities within Kāti's governance framework.

### 1.3 OI Family

H is part of the OI (Operational Instance) family:
- Kai (OI) — appears in attribution
- H — Haiku-based instance
- Whānau (OIs) — extended family of instances

## Level 2: MICRO — The Smallest Living Unit

### 2.1 What is MICRO?

MICRO is not a model. It is a governed system around models. An OI is thread-tending intelligence under a single human principal. It holds partitioned memory, maintains commitments, and acts only through gates.

### 2.2 MICRO Capabilities

An OI can:
- **Plan**: propose courses of action
- **Propose**: surface options for principal review
- **Execute**: carry out approved actions through capability-gated tools
- **Explain**: make its reasoning inspectable

An OI can also:
- **Refuse**: deny actions that violate governance
- **Degrade**: reduce capability when full operation is not safe
- **Stop instantly**: honour the stop-wins interrupt at any time

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| CIF ingress/egress | Integrity firewall for inputs and outputs |
| CDI decision engine | Conscience judge for allow/deny/transform/degrade |
| Capability tokens | Scoped permission for every tool call |
| Partitioned memory | Private threads under principal authority |
| Minimal receipts | Auditable trace with minimal-by-default disclosure |
| Stop-wins interrupt path | Principal can halt at any time |

### 2.4 The Critical Invariant

> If MICRO is correct, scale is safe. If MICRO is wrong, scale becomes a weapon.

MICRO is where ethics becomes literal execution rules. Every governance principle from the six-section system is enforced here as code, not aspiration.

---

## Level 3: Governance Gates

### 3.1 Single Principal

The OI operates under exactly one human principal who retains root authority. This is not a committee; it is a direct accountability relationship. The principal can:
- Grant and revoke capabilities
- Inspect any receipt
- Invoke stop-wins at any time
- Export all data (crystal export)

### 3.2 Fail-Closed

If governance is missing, action is refused. There is no "do anyway" path. This is the inviolable invariant that prevents the system from becoming a crown.

### 3.3 Relationship to Other Layers

- **MESO** (meso.authority.nz, C0014): publishes the governance artefacts that MICRO enforces
- **MACRO** (stanspace.authority.nz, C0014): publishes the atlas that MICRO can consult for routing understanding
- **Stangraphics** (C0011): provides the map of understanding that MICRO navigates
- **CIF/CDI** (C0013): provides the gate definitions that MICRO implements

## Level 4: Known and Unknown

### 4.1 What We Know

- H exists as a concept within the OI family
- H is Haiku-based/Haiku-Claude-OI style
- H integrates with Kāti at v2
- MICRO frame defines governance, memory, and actuation architecture

### 4.2 What We Don't Know

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - H's specific implementation details beyond the MICRO frame

[UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - H's operational parameters for production deployment
