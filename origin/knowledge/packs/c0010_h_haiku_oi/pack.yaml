title: "H / Haiku-Based OI Seed — MICRO Governance Frame"
summary: >
  H is a Haiku-based / Haiku-Claude-OI style instance. Integrates with Kāti
  in a version bump (v1 → v2). As MICRO in the six-section collation, the OI is
  the smallest living unit: thread-tending intelligence under a single human principal
  with partitioned memory, capability-gated actuation, stop-wins interrupt path,
  and fail-closed gates. Not a model but a governed system around models. MICRO is
  where ethics becomes literal execution rules.

tests_or_falsifiers:
  - name: Single principal
    description: The OI operates under exactly one human principal with root authority
    falsification_condition: Multiple principals with conflicting root authority, or no principal identified
  - name: Gate completeness
    description: All actuation passes through CIF, CDI, capability, and receipt gates
    falsification_condition: An actuation path exists that bypasses any governance gate
  - name: Stop-wins integrity
    description: The principal can halt the OI at any time via stop-wins interrupt
    falsification_condition: System cannot be stopped when the principal requests it
  - name: Fail-closed operation
    description: If governance is missing, action is refused
    falsification_condition: Action proceeds when governance context is absent
  - name: Kāti integration noted
    description: H documentation references Kāti integration requirement
    falsification_condition: No mention of Kāti relationship
