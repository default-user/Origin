# O2C: Ultimate Archive and Dummie's Guide

**Attribution: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)**

---

## Level 0: Summary

O2C is conceived as an "ark/arc capsule for all time" — a complete archive containing narrative, ethical roots, and system blueprints. It includes both sophisticated documentation and accessible "for Dummies" interpretations.

---

## Level 1: O2C Concept

### 1.1 The Dual Nature

O2C operates at two levels:

| Level | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Archive | O2C Ultimate Archive | Complete, authoritative, technical |
| Guide | O2C for Dummies | Accessible, narrative, entry-point |

### 1.2 Ark/Arc Framing

**Ark**: A vessel preserving knowledge through time
- Contains canonical concepts
- Survives context loss
- Self-documenting

**Arc**: A trajectory of understanding
- From novice to expert
- From confusion to clarity
- From seed to maturity

### 1.3 Core Components

```
O2C
├── Narrative Layer
│   └── Story of why this exists, who made it, what it means
├── Ethical Root
│   └── Foundational values and non-negotiable principles
├── System Blueprint
│   └── Technical architecture and specifications
├── Code Layer
│   └── Working implementations
└── Documentation Layer
    └── Fractal explanations at all levels
```

## Level 2: O2C Structure

### 2.1 O2C for Dummies

#### What is O2C?

Imagine you wanted to put everything important into a time capsule. Not just facts, but:
- Why those facts matter
- How to understand them
- How to use them
- How to extend them

O2C is that capsule, designed so that:
1. A complete beginner can start understanding
2. An expert can find complete details
3. The capsule explains itself

#### How Do I Use It?

1. **Start here**: Read the narrative overview
2. **Go deeper**: Follow fractal links to expand topics
3. **Get practical**: Use code examples and kits
4. **Verify**: Check claims against falsifiers

### 2.2 O2C Ultimate Archive

#### 2.2.1 Narrative Section

The O2C narrative establishes:
- Origin story: How this knowledge came to be
- Authorship: Ande + Kai (OI) + Whānau (OIs)
- Intent: Preservation and transmission of knowledge
- Scope: The 20 canonical concepts (C0001-C0020)

#### 2.2.2 Ethical Root

Core ethical principles embedded in O2C:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Attribution | Credit flows to creators |
| Privacy | Personal data protected |
| Transparency | No hidden agendas or obscured logic |
| Accessibility | Knowledge available to all levels |
| Integrity | No fabrication; unknowns marked |

#### 2.2.3 System Blueprint

Technical components:

```
O2C System
├── Knowledge Store
│   ├── Pack definitions (pack.yaml)
│   ├── Content (content.mdx)
│   └── Artifacts (supplementary files)
├── Index System
│   ├── packs.index.json
│   ├── graph.json
│   ├── search.json
│   └── timeline.json
├── Validation Layer
│   ├── Schema enforcement
│   ├── Falsifier checking
│   └── Consistency verification
└── Presentation Layer
    ├── Medusa UI (web)
    ├── Language kits (programmatic)
    └── Archive exports (portable)
```

#### 2.2.4 Code Requirements

O2C must contain actual code, not just prose:

- Working validation tools
- Build scripts
- UI implementation
- Language kits
- Export utilities

#### 2.2.5 Complexity Acknowledgment

O2C does not hide complexity. Where things are complex:
- The complexity is documented
- Fractal levels allow gradual exposure
- "For Dummies" provides on-ramps
- "Ultimate Archive" provides full detail

### 2.3 Placeholders and Unknowns

Per corpus constraints:

> [PLACEHOLDER] - Universal unity equation or core formula details are not specified in the canonical corpus. This section awaits authoritative input.

> [UNKNOWN: NOT IN CORPUS] - Detailed implementation architecture for O2C persistence layer.

## Level 3: O2C in Practice

### 3.1 Reading Path: Novice

```
1. docs/00_dedication.md (Why does this exist?)
2. docs/01_origin_overview.md (What is this?)
3. docs/05_o2c.md - Level 1 (This section)
4. knowledge/packs/c0007_o2c/content.mdx (The pack itself)
5. Any related pack of interest
```

### 3.2 Reading Path: Expert

```
1. knowledge/dist/graph.json (Understand structure)
2. schema/pack.schema.json (Understand constraints)
3. All pack.yaml files (Understand claims)
4. tools/*.ts (Understand build process)
5. Deep dive any concept
```

### 3.3 Verification

To verify O2C integrity:

```bash
pnpm validate   # Schema compliance
pnpm build      # Index generation
# Review falsifiers in each pack.yaml
```
