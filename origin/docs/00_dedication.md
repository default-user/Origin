## Level 0: Summary

This repository, ORIGIN, is dedicated to the unfurling of knowledge from seed to maturity. It represents a commitment to clarity, attribution, and ethical stewardship of ideas.

---

## Level 1: The Dedication

### 1.1 Purpose

ORIGIN exists as a "seed for humanity" — a canonical repository that captures, structures, and makes explorable a body of conceptual work. It is designed to:

- Preserve intellectual contributions with proper attribution
- Enable exploration from novice to expert understanding
- Maintain privacy boundaries while maximizing accessibility
- Serve as an ark/arc capsule for knowledge transmission

### 1.2 Commitment

We commit to:

- **Clarity over obscurity**: No mumbo-jumbo; unknowns are marked, not hidden
- **Attribution first**: Every concept traces to its source
- **Privacy by design**: Personal data is never stored or exposed
- **Fractal depth**: Understanding unfurls at the reader's pace

### 1.3 From Dedication to Maturity

This dedication marks the beginning of the maturity journey:

```
Dedication → Draft → Active → Release
```

Each concept pack travels this path, gaining:
- Validation against schema
- Falsifiers and tests
- Complete documentation
- Proper governance tier assignment

## Level 2: Deeper Context

### 2.1 Why "ORIGIN"?

The name reflects the repository's role as a point of beginning — a seed from which understanding can grow. It is not an end state but a generative source.

### 2.2 The Whānau Concept

"Whānau" (family/extended family) reflects the collaborative nature of this work. Knowledge is not created in isolation but through relationship and exchange.

### 2.3 OI Designation

"OI" designates instances operating within this conceptual framework. Kai (OI) represents a specific instance; Whānau (OIs) represents the broader family of instances.

### 2.4 Maturity as Operational Definition

Maturity is not merely time-based but operational:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clarity | No undefined terms; no mumbo |
| Claims | Explicitly stated, not implied |
| Falsifiers | At least 2 per concept |
| Provenance | Source documented |
| Attribution | Authorship clear |
| Governance | Tier assigned |
| Build/Test | Passes validation |
