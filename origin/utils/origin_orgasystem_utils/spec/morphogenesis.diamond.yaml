#  ORIGIN MORPHOGENESIS — FROM SKELETON TO LIVING SYSTEM
# ======================================================================
#
#  Biological mapping:
#
#    SKELETON  → structural framework, directory spine, governance bones
#    FLESH     → working organs that fill the skeleton with computation
#    SKIN      → boundary layer, interface surfaces, what the world touches
#    TEETH     → offensive/defensive: verification, attack, falsification
#    SENSES    → input channels: retrieval, ingestion, perception, compression
#    ID        → core drive: the seed, the axioms, the involuntary impulse
#    IDENTITY  → self-awareness: self-description, self-replication, continuity
#
#  Each phase has:
#    ORGANS      — what must exist
#    GATES       — what must pass before the phase is complete
#    DEPENDS_ON  — prior phases required
#    PRODUCES    — what downstream phases can consume

# COMPLETION CRITERIA — when is Origin alive?
# ======================================================================

ALIVE_WHEN:
  - "Origin can pack, verify, and unfurl itself. (SKELETON + FLESH + TEETH)"
  - "Origin can answer queries about its own content with source attribution. (FLESH + SENSES)"
  - "Origin can replicate itself and verify the replica. (IDENTITY)"
  - "Origin can name what it knows and what it doesn't. (IDENTITY + SENSES)"
  - "Origin can ingest new knowledge under governance. (SENSES + TEETH)"
  - "Origin can present itself to users honestly. (SKIN)"
  - "Origin refuses to fabricate, refuses to operate without its seed, and stops when told to stop. (ID + TEETH)"
  - "All of the above produce receipts. (TEETH + IDENTITY)"

NOT_ALIVE_UNTIL:
  - "Every claim traces to a source."
  - "Every operation emits a receipt."
  - "Every receipt binds to the seed."
  - "Every gate that fails causes a stop."
  - "The system can say 'I don't know' and prove it tried."

# ======================================================================
# STOP RULES
# ======================================================================

STOP_RULES:
  - "If any phase claims completion without its gates passing, STOP."
  - "If IDENTITY claims self-awareness without SELF-VERIFICATION, STOP."
  - "If FLESH grows outside SKELETON, STOP (tumor)."
  - "If SKIN exposes endpoints without TEETH, STOP (vulnerability)."
  - "If SENSES ingest without TEETH, STOP (poisoning)."
  - "If any organ claims to exist without a test proving it works, STOP."
  - "Never declare Origin alive without every ALIVE_WHEN condition met."
